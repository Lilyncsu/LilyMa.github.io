Welcome to my blog! I am currently a master's student in _Statistics_ at NC State University. My personal career goals include becoming a **Data Scientist**. 
Outside of work, I like hiking, traveling, gardening, and reading books. 

### More Information

I just joined the "Mu Sigma Rho" group at NC State [Link](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/msr/). I'm taking three Statistics courses this summer: Data Science for Statisticians, SAS Programming 2, and Fundamentals of Linear Models and Regression. I think these classes and all other statistical courses are super helpful to further my career. You can see more about my work experience, technical skills, and academic activities through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xingli-ma-712b20112/).

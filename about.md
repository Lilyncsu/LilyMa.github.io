### More Information

I just joined the $ Mu Sigma Rho $ group at NC State. I'm taking the three Statistics courses this summer: SAS Programming 2, Data Science for Statisticians, and Fundamentals of Linear Models and Regression. I think these classes and all other classes in the graduate program in Statistics are super helpful to further my career in the future.

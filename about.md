Welcome to my blog! I am currently a master's student in _Statistics_ at NC State University. My personal career goals include becoming a **Data Scientist**. 
Outside of work, I like hiking, traveling, gardening, and reading books. 

### More Information

I just joined the "Mu Sigma Rho" group at NC State [Link](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/msr/). I'm taking three Statistics courses this summer: SAS Programming 2, Data Science for Statisticians, and Fundamentals of Linear Models and Regression. I think these classes and all other classes in the graduate program in Statistics are super helpful to further my career in the future. You can see more about my work experience, technical skills, and academic activities through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xingli-ma-712b20112/).

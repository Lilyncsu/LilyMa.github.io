## Programming Languages: R vs Others, which is your favorite?  

*1.	My thoughts on R vs other software that I've used* 

First of all, R is an open-source software. It is free for everyone. As long as you have a computer and an internet connection, you can download the R software from [its website](https://www.r-project.org/ and install it on your computer and run your programs).    

It also has an Integrated Development Environment, which is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.    

Moreover, R Markdown documents provide quick, reproducible reporting from R. When you write your document in markdown, it allows you to embed executable R code chunks with the knitr syntax. You can update your document at any time by re-knitting the code chunks. You can then convert your document into several common formats, such PDF, HTML, Word, etc. After I learned how to use [R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/), I almost never use R scripts again. It is so convenient to generate different type of reports and documents for effective communication.    

Furthermore, there are a lot of online resources help you improve your R programming skills, such as online tutorials, documents, packages, posts from [R documentation](https://www.r-project.org/other-docs.html), [github](https://github.com/ , Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/], that you can explore new functions, help with checking your code, debugging, and download new packages for free.    

At last, I want to share a some of my experience in using other programming languages. I like using Python for ArcGIS to do geospatial analysis and Java script for API to build web applications. I prefer to use SAS for analysis of clinical trials, survival analysis, genetic analysis because some industry regulations set by the FDA.

*2.	What functionality do you like about R?*  
  
In R, most of the time, you have several ways to achieve your goals. I also like that RStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of the screen: Source Editor, Console, Workspace Browser (and History), and Plots (and Files, Packages, Help).

*3.	What parts do you miss about your other language?*   
 
SAS can produce very nice reports, which I like the most. I also like the macro variables, which make my programs more dynamic and efficient. I like Python in ArcGIS, which can produce very pretty maps, do batch processing, realize real-time visualization.

*4.	Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?*   

Overall, I think R is easy to learn. But the code can change over time; the version updated very fast; a lot of functionalities like “black boxes”, you need to have a sound statistics knowledge to understand the underling structures and rationales behind the scenes. Also, the debugging tools are not as efficient as that SAS (check the log) and Python (debugging tools) provided.  

Finally, like *Forrest Gump* said: **life is like a box of chocolates**, each programming language is also like a box of chocolates, you get to choose your favorite one. Along the way, you may want to try different flavors.

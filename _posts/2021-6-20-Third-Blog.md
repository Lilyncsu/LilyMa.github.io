title: "Project 1: NHL Vignette"

** 1. Intruduction **
This project created a vignette for reading and summarizing data from the National Hockey League’s (NHL) API. 
Three main components are present in this vignette: *extracting tables and querying information from NFL Records API*, 
*extracting tables and querying information from NFL Stats API*, and *exploratory data analysis*.

** Progress Interesting finding **

** Process reflection**

– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?

Here is the link to project 1 (github pages repo)[https://xingli-ma.github.io/Project1_NHL_Vignette/] and my (usual repo)[https://github.com/Xingli-Ma/Project1_NHL_Vignette]!

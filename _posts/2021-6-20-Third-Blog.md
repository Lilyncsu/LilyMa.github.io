**1. Intruduction**    

This project created a vignette for reading and summarizing data from the National Hockey League’s (NHL) API. Three main components are present in this vignette: *extracting tables and querying information from NFL Records API*, *extracting tables and querying information from NFL Stats API*, and *exploratory data analysis*.

**Interesting finding**    

It's the first time I access [NFL Records API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/records-api.md) and [NFL Stats API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md). It has plenty of information. Though it is easy to retrieve most of the information from the APIs, it's hard for me to do the data analysis part, because of lacking basic Hockey knowledge. I was surprised that they have so detailed stats about teams and players, etc. This project improved not only my programming skills but also my passion for sports statistics!

**Process reflection**    

– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?    

It took me couple hours to read the project instruction and figure out what we are required to do, because the instruction is very brief and concise. Designing the query funtion took most of the time, because I had to think what kind of information the user would like to know, and tried to make it easy to query.    

– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?    

I would start eailier. I would look for more relevant backgroud information and search for some good Vignettes.

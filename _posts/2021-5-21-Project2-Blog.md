title: "Project 2: Creating Predictive Models and Automating Markdown Reports on Bike Sharing Data"
---

**1. Introduction**    

The purpose of this project is to create **predictive models** and **automate Markdown reports**. Please check [the project's GitHub page](https://xingli-ma.github.io/ST558_Project2/).

**2. Interesting finding**    

It is a lot of fun to work on a collaborative project on GitHub. I appreciate that everyone has different solutions to the same problem. Automating Markdown reports can make our code more efficient and can save a lot of time. We found that the best model for predicting the number of rental bikes is different on each day of the week.    

**3. Process reflection**        

– What would you do differently?        

This is a collaborative project between me and my classmate, so it is important to find an efficient way to communicate and keep everyone on the same page. We used Gmail hangout instant messages and zoom meetings to communicate information. It works very well for us. However, we did encounter some conflicts when we both do git push on the same .rmd file. Next time, we will stagger the push time to reduce conflicts.

– What was the most difficult part for you?    

I think the data exploratory analysis is important and crucial for successful analysis and report. I spend most of the time on the summarizations, model selections, and automation reports.

– What are your big take-aways from the project?  

Understanding your data and variable type is crucial for selecting appropriate models.

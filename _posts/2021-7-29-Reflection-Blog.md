### 1. Intruduction        

This blog is a reflection on my first blog: what being a **Data Science** is about and my thoughts on **R**.      

### 2. Initial Thoughts       

My initial thoughts on being a **Data Scientist** focused too much on data collection, processing, analysis, and interpretation, as well as programming skills and statistics. My knowledge about **R** was one-sided and very limited.     

### 3. Reflection          

#### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?    
Expect good technical skills, being an excellent **Data Scientist** must have a good understanding of the subject matter, the scientific context, the development processes of products and business. Their starting point and focus should be to solve practical problems in the real world. They also need to have good communication skills to gain understanding and support from decision-makers and stakeholders, and xplain their results and appropriate applications of their results.  

#### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?    


#### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

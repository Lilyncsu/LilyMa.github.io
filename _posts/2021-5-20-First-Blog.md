title: Being A Data Scientist
---

1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
A data scientist needs to gather, process, and derive valuable insights from the data, help businesses achieve sustainable growth, and make better business decisions. They explore all aspects of the business and develop programs using programming languages like Python, SAS, R, Java, and SQL to perform robust analytics.

2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
My personal career goals include being an excellent Data Scientist that utilizes expertise and experience in data science and data visualization, machine learning, data mining, Bayesian statistics, optimization and simulation, risk modeling, spatial statistics, and computational and theoretical statistics, to deliver innovations in terms of statistical models, predictive models, software, algorithms, time series analysis, databases, advanced information systems, data-driven applications, and web services.

3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
To be a good data scientist, we should know the differences between a data scientist and a traditional statistician. They are different in modeling processes, the size of data consumed, the types of problems studied, the academic background, and the terminology used. For example, their data collection methods are different. Data scientists can use satellites, radars, UAVs to collect large-scale, consequent datasets, while statisticians often use surveys, polls, and experiments to collect smaller scale data. Data scientists also spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing, and transformation. Second, data scientists focus on the predictive accuracy of the model. They compare a number of different methods/algorithms to create the best machine learning model, while statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data by addressing and verified their model assumptions.

4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I started as a statistician. Along the way, I gain the key skills and abilities that a data scientist required. I have also accumulated a solid fundamental knowledge in interdisciplinary areas, such as mathematical statistics, biostatistics, spatial statistics, environmental statistics, bioinformatics, risk analysis, epidemiology, environmental sciences, agro-informatics, and agricultural economics.
